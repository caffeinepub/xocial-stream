  "summary": "Xocial.Stream is live on ICP via Caffeine and has evolved into a lightweight, calm video-sharing app with a strict 'no clutter' principle and explicit manager approval required before builds. Key UX/features implemented and deployed through iterations include: persisted upload status states (Uploading→Processing→Live), Continue Watching (quiet resume), search + categories discovery, automatic + manual thumbnails, and deletion permissions (users delete only their own videos; admin can delete any). Sharing UX was iterated and ultimately kept minimal (Copy Link + Timestamp only), with external social share + QR removed. Admin-only tooling is grouped under an Admin dropdown (Principal ID, Architecture, Payment Settings) and admin visibility remains identity/session dependent across browsers (Chrome vs Edge). Stripe setup remained fragile at times (save/load failures, pricing page 'Payment configuration not available'), leading to temporary Stripe Settings access paths; paid plan buttons were eventually restored to working. Footer/navigation direction continued toward a minimal TuoraSystems-branded footer (Pricing/Terms/Privacy/Support) and removing Architecture from public UI; Community & Ethics Policy is intended to be linked contextually (e.g., Upload/Pricing) rather than duplicated in the footer. Pricing copy/heading was updated again with 'Start Free, Grow Limitless. Plans and Pricing Made Simple.' plus homepage tagline 'Upload everything. Share without limits.' and Pro blurb 'Finally, a video platform without storage anxiety. Unlimited video. One simple price.' Creator Plus plan marketing remains restricted to only implemented features (Custom branding + Private collections), deferring analytics/password protection/scheduling promises.",
