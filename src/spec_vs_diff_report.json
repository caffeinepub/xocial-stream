  "summary": "FAQPage.tsx was updated to use a single in-file FAQ_CONTENT constant with heading “Xocial.Stream — FAQ” and an accordion of Q/A items. However, the diff is truncated and does not provide enough evidence to confirm that all 15 required questions are present in the exact required order and that all answers match the owner-provided copy verbatim. Additionally, unrelated files (frontend-file-summaries.txt, project_state.json) were modified though not requested.",

      "requirement": "FAQ accordion contains exactly the 15 specified questions in this order, with answers displayed exactly as provided by the owner (no added/removed/rewritten text), and all paragraph breaks/list lines match the provided text.",
      "reason": "The FAQPage.tsx diff is truncated and only shows the beginning portion of the items; it is not possible from the provided diff summary to verify that all 15 questions exist in the required order, nor that the full answer text (including paragraph breaks and the upload-limits plan list formatting) matches the owner-provided copy exactly.",
