  "summary": "The diff clearly introduces new zoom-related state in VideoPage (including a default-off `zoomModeEnabled` flag), but the provided truncated test diff does not show any new Playwright coverage to assert zoom controls are hidden by default and only appear after explicit enable.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Update/extend Playwright smoke coverage (or add a focused UI test) to verify VideoPage does not show custom zoom controls by default and that zoom controls only become visible/usable after enabling zoom mode, using stable selectors.",
      "reason": "The visible portion of the modified Playwright smoke test file does not include any assertions about zoom controls visibility/enablement or usage of stable `data-testid` selectors for the zoom toggle/controls.",
